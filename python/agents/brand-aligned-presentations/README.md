## 3. Architecture: How it Works

The agent operates as a coordinated pipeline, mimicking the workflow of a human consulting team:

1. **Planning & Research (Internal & External):**
   *   **Internal:** Queries Vertex AI Search for relevant IP and past proposals.
   *   **External:** Queries Google Search / Deep Research for current market context.
2. **Synthesis:** Organizes raw data into a coherent narrative aligned with the firm's value propositions.
3. **Deck Specification:** Generates a DeckSpec (JSON) defining the structure, slide content, targeted bolding, and speaker notes.
4. **Rendering:** Merges the DeckSpec with the corporate PowerPoint Template, generating high-quality images via Imagen 3 where requested.
5. **Output:** Uploads the final `.pptx` to Google Cloud Storage as a secure artifact,also available for direct download within the Gemini Enterprise interface.

## 5. Getting Started & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Google Cloud SDK installed and authenticated.
- Vertex AI API enabled on your Google Cloud Project.
- **Corporate Template:** A `.pptx` master file stored in a Google Cloud Storage bucket.(docs/pptx_template_guide.md)

### Authentication & IAM Roles
Ensure your service account (or user account) has the following permissions:
- **Vertex AI User** (`roles/aiplatform.user`): For calling Gemini/Imagen.
- **Storage Object Admin** (`roles/storage.objectAdmin`): For reading templates/writing decks.
- **Service Account User** (`roles/iam.serviceAccountUser`): Required for Agent Engine deployment.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-repository-directory>
    ```

2. **Configure Environment**
    Create a `.env` file and populate it with your specific resources, following the template:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    **Required Variables:**
    - `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`: Your Project ID.
    - `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION`: Region (e.g., `us-central1`).
    - `GEMINI_MODEL_NAME`: e.g., `gemini-2.5-flash`.
    - `IMAGE_GENERATION_MODEL`: e.g., `imagen-3.0-generate-002`.
    - `GCP_STAGING_BUCKET`: Bucket name for artifacts (e.g., `gs://my-bucket`).
    - `DEFAULT_TEMPLATE_URI`: URI of the master template (e.g., `gs://bucket/Proposal_Template.pptx`).
    - `AS_APP`: Gemini Enterprise app ID.
    - `DATASTORE_ID`: Vertex AI Search Datastore ID for internal RAG (Format: `projects/{PROJECT_ID}/locations/{LOCATION}/collections/default_collection/dataStores/{DATA_STORE_ID}`).
    - `ENABLE_RAG`: Set to ‘false’ by default; requires manual RAG database configuration by the user.
    - `ENABLE_DEEP_RESEARCH`: Set to ‘false’ by default; requires project-level allowlisting before activation.

3. **Install Dependencies**
    Using `uv` (recommended):
    ```bash
    uv sync --dev
    gcloud auth application-default login
    ```

### Alternative: Using Agent Starter Pack

You can also use the [Agent Starter Pack](https://goo.gle/agent-starter-pack) to create a production-ready version of this agent with additional deployment options:

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the starter pack and create your project
pip install --upgrade agent-starter-pack
agent-starter-pack create my-research-deck-agent -a adk@brand-aligned-presentations
```

<details>
<summary>⚡️ Alternative: Using uv</summary>

If you have [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) installed, you can create and set up your project with a single command:
```bash
uvx agent-starter-pack create my-research-deck-agent -a adk@brand-aligned-presentations
```
This command handles creating the project without needing to pre-install the package into a virtual environment.

## 6. Local Development & Testing

### Running the Agent Locally
Start the agent's web server locally:
```bash
uv run adk web --port 8000 .
```
You can now interact with the agent by sending prompts to `http://localhost:8000`.

### Evaluation & Testing
We use a dual-evaluation approach testing both structural integrity and narrative quality across the full lifecycle.

1. **Structural & Unit Tests (Pytest)**: Ensures the agent's internal logic, configuration, and PPTX rendering tools handle edge cases gracefully without crashing. Evaluates the `get_smart_layout` fallback logic.
    ```bash
    uv run pytest tests/
    ```

2. **End-to-End Lifecycle Evaluation**: A full mock session testing the multi-agent delegation, JSON generation, physical `.pptx` artifact creation, and subsequent interactive surgical edits. Evaluated via an LLM-as-a-judge framework.
    ```bash
    uv run python -m eval.eval_pipeline
    ```
---

## 7. Customization & Extension

### Modifying the Flow
- **Prompts:** Tweak the core orchestration logic and instructions in `presentation_agent/prompt.py`. This file controls the dual "Create" and "Edit" workflows.
- **Sub-Agents:** Modify sub-agent behaviors (Deep Research, Synthesis) in `presentation_agent/sub_agents/`.

### Adding Tools
To add new external APIs or utilities, place them in `presentation_agent/tools/` and register them as `FunctionTool` objects in the `agent_tools` array within `presentation_agent/agent.py`.

### User-Provided Templates 
Users can provide your own `.pptx` templates. To achieve flawless formatting without the Python engine resorting to programmatic resizing hacks, the provided template should follow (docs/pptx_template_guide.md)

## 8. Deployment to Agent Engine & Registration

#### 1. Deploy to Agent Engine
Use the `deploy.py` script located in the `deployment/` folder to containerize and push the agent.

**To Create a New App:**
```bash
uv run python deployment/deploy.py --mode create
```
*Note: This will automatically update the `AGENT_ENGINE_ID` in your `.env` file.*

**To Update an Existing App:**
```bash
uv run python deployment/deploy.py --mode update
```

#### 2. Register to Gemini Enterprise
Once deployed, register the agent so it can be discovered as a Tool/Agent in Gemini Enterprise.

1. Copy the configuration template:
    ```bash
    cd agent_registration.
    cp config_template.json config.json
    ```
2. Fill out `config.json` with your project details, app ID, and the Agent Engine ID (`adk_deployment_id`).
3. Run the registration wrapper:
    ```bash
    python as_registry_client.py register_agent --config config.json
    ```

## 9. Example
**User Prompt:** "Create a 10-slide presentation for analyzing investment opportunities in the biotech industry. Use the default template. Don’t generate the presentation until I ask, I need to check the presentation outline first."

**Agent Output:**
Inspect the template and plan the deck outline.
Research investment opportunities  in the biotech industry. (external search)
Search internal docs for methodology.(internal search if provided)
Show the outline of presentation for user approval
 
**User Prompt:** “Outline approved. Please generate the presentation now. Make sure to use my default template, follow the research plan, and use the same layout as the presentation outline above.”

**Agent Output:** Agent generates the powerpoint file and provides a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) URI and a direct download link for the completed PowerPoint presentation.
